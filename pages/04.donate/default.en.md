My day-to-day job does pay the bills and keeping me warm during those long Canadian winter nights, but some people do like to show their support from time to time. It does feel great to know what I do matter and it does encourage me to continue sharing my knowledge, and learning new stuff at the same time.

If you're one of those people who like to show their support, you can always [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/lcharette).

[You can also find me on Paypal](https://paypal.me/LouisCharette) or can [get in touch](mailto:hello@bbqsoftwares.com) if you want to show your support in another way.

A free way of supporting me can also be sharing my work, my blog posts or leaving comments on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LouisCharette) !
