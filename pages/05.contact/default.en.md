Support questions about my projects should be asked on the project's GitHub page. You can also find me on the [UserFrosting Chat](https://chat.userfrosting.com) most of the time for direct support. Alternatively, you can always reach me on social media :

Some people like to show their financial support for projects and creators they love. But don't worry for me, as my day-to-day job pays the bills and keeps me warm during those long Canadian winter nights. Still, if you insist on showing your support, you can always [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/lcharette). It does feel great to know what I do matter and it does encourage me to continue sharing my knowledge and passion.
