# About

Louis is a civil engineer from Montréal, Québec who has a passion for coding. Over the last 10+ years, he has worked on many small projects, learning everything on his own before getting involved with bigger projects. He is one of the main contributors for SimpsonsCity.com and one of the main developers of [UserFrosting](https://www.userfrosting.com/), an open source user-management framework. His latest work includes creating UserFrosting's Internationalization module, a module crucial to him as a multi-lingual software developer in Canada, where software requires support for both official languages, English and French, as well as UserFrosting's Bakery CLI interface. He's currently working on new PHP-based software as a part of his masters degree in Civil Engineering. Overall, he likes to share his knowledge by helping others, the same way he was helped when he first started coding.
