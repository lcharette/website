### About Me

I'm a Civil Engineer from Montréal, Québec who has a passion for coding. While my full-time job has nothing to do with coding, my principal hobby is and has been for almost 15 years now.

Coding wise, I worked on many small projects, learning everything on my own before getting involved with bigger projects. I'm one of the main contributors to the now almost defunct [SimpsonsCity.com](https://simpsonscity.com) and one of the main developers of [UserFrosting](https://www.userfrosting.com/), an open-source user-management framework.

My latest work includes creating UserFrosting's [Internationalization module](https://github.com/userfrosting/i18n), a module crucial to me as a multilingual software developer from Canada where software supporting both official languages, English and French, are common. I also worked UserFrosting's Bakery CLI interface and I'm currently working on brining UserFrosting Code Coverage as close as possible to 100%. <!--See the [projects page](/projects) for a full list of what I've been working on recently.-->

On the academic side, I have a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from _École de Technologie Supérieure_ (ÉTS) as well as a master's degree in urban infrastructure management, also from ÉTS, for which I worked on a PHP-based proof-of-concept software dedicated to project management and cost tracking.

Overall, I like to share my knowledge by helping others, the same way I was helped when I first started coding.


### What is BBQSoftwares?

Simply put, it’s me. One of my first (successful?) app was called _BBQ_. It was a small device loan management software. Think of the software a library would use to track which book has been borrowed by whom, but for small electronic devices like iPhones and iPads. That name stuck around me for a while. At some point, I needed a domain name and... you get the rest.
